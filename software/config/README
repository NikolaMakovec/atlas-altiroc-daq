There are way too many configs, so here is a description of them all:
#####################################################################
defaults.yml: Should be loaded everytime a new test is run. Loading this config is effectively like performing a power-cycle on the board, without having to actually power-cycle the board. It sets every single register on the board to the default value (the "default value" being the value that register takes when the board is first powered on)

testBojanV1.yml: ?

testBojanV2.yml: The de-facto configuration file, primarily used by test_Bojan.py. When in doubt, refer to this

testBojanV2_twoPixReadout.yml: A copy of testBonanV2.yml, meant to test

disable_readout.yml
enable_readout.yml: Exists only to either enable or disable the "EnableReadout" bit on every board at the same time

master_slave_example.yml: basic example of how to setup a master and slave testbeam configuration

asic_config_B2.yml ->to be used to run B2 alone, all channels on, probes off, sets corrects vth corr.
asic_config_B3.yml ->to be used to run B3 alone, all channels on, probes off, sets corrects vth corr.
asic_config_B6.yml
asic_config_B7.yml
asic_config_B8.yml: basic configurations of the appropriate board, which sets board specific thresholds for general calibration pulse testing

asic_config_B2_slave.yml
asic_config_B3_master.yml -> slave-master configurations for use in the testbeam -> updated with latest vth_corr, all channels on (good channels), must be used toghether

asic_config_B2_slave_calibPulse.yml
asic_config_B3_master_calibPulse.yml: like the above, but these configs are set to allow calibration pulses, with only one channel reading out

asic_config_B2_TBalone.yml: similar to the slave-master pairs, but meant to be run in the testbeam by themselves (they're all master)
asic_config_B3_TBalone.yml

asic_vthcorr_B2B3.yml: loads threshold corrections for boards 2 and 3

config_v2B6_noPAprobe.yml: ?

config_v2B6_probe.yml: ?

config_v2B7_scurve.yml: 

pll-config: contains pll configurations

testbeam_config.yml: ?
